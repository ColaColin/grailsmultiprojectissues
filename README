So here right now I've done this:

grails create-app htWp
grails create-plugin htCommons
created the settings.gradle
added the compile project dependency to htWp

in htCommons:
	added the spring dependency
	grails compile to load them. At this location I got this issue https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/9759 so my grails CLI was broken. To fix I switched to grails 3.1.x here. So the projects are created with grails 3.1.3, but from here I have to use the branch 3.1.x build myself.


copied over the spring config from the plugin to the app

created the ApiController in htWp with a simple test function

when I now start grails via run-app and navigate to the index of the ApiController I get this error:

URI
    /api/index
Class
    groovy.lang.MissingMethodException
Message
    null
Caused by
    No signature of method: htwp.ApiController.getAuthenticatedUser() is applicable for argument types: () values: [] Possible solutions: getAuthenticatedUser()

It seems using the GORM classes works now. This "getAuthenticatedUser() isn't available in the controller" is one of maybe 5 errors that have been playing hide and seek with me all day. I dunno what is going on.
